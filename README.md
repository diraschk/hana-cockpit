# hana-cockpit
HANA Cockpit is a collection of utilities to perform common tasks when playing in HANA.  These same tasks can be accomplished in `hdbsql` or **HANA Studio** via SQL, however in cases where neither client tool is readily available, or you do not wish to install or use these tools, this is a lightweight alternative.

# Usage
```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 entmike/hana-cockpit
```
